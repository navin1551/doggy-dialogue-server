## Motivation

I was inspired to create an app that allows dog lovers to have a community where they can ask and answer all questions about dogs. As a dog lover and owner myself I've found that I always have some question come up regarding training, feeding or just general dog stuff and felt motivated to create a forum all about dogs.
